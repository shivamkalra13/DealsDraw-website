## Work as a Team
##### _EACH TEAM MEMBER MUST CLONE THE PROJECT — DO NOT FORK IT!_


## Adding a new feature

> **master** is a protected branch and hence cannot be modified directly by anyone.

Everytime someone wants to add a new feature, create a new branch for it and open a pull request when you are done.
If your pull request gets at least 1 approval then it can be merged to master.


## _Important Reminders:_

* Before creating a new branch, make sure you are up to date with the master branch.
* Tell your team every time a pull request has been merged with master. Don’t let your team members fall behind master.
* Pull often, just to be sure. Even if no one has told you about changes on master, pull anyways. It doesn’t hurt.
* Under Branches on GitHub you can find a visual representation of how far behind or head your branch is from master.
* Double check with team members before merging.
* Make sure you are on a branch before you start working. Get in the habit of checking.
